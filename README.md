# to-do-python
An experiment where I made a to-do list in Python that stores data in .txt files and do string processing. Created 13/01/2026. Intended to be like command-line interfaces.

Yes, I am very aware that storing this kind of thing in text files is horribly inefficient. However, at the point when I made the program, I did not care and just wanted to see if it was possible for me to develop something like this as fast as possible.

## How to use:
I did not intend this to be used by other people, so if you wish to customise it, you'd have to read through a lot of messy code. There is some varying amount of documentation inside.
1. Download everything into the same folder (EVERYTHING, including todo.txt and todoArchive.txt).
2. Open your favourite IDE for Python (preferably VSCode or something similar, I used it since I can open the txt files next to the code).
3. Run the program.

## Future goals for the project
I do not wish to improve heavily on this program, given that it was built on a whim. It is not designed very well.

If I ever revisit this, I may create a version that, for one, doesn't use text files to store data, and two, is more usable to the average person.
